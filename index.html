<h4>Kuskok for Administrators</h4>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Measure student growth based on the skills that are being taught in the classroom.</li>
<li>Student growth assessment occurs throughout the year while students 
complete online classroom assignments: there is no need for separate 
testing days.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 product-explanation">
<h4>Kuskok for Teachers</h4>
<p>Pick a skill to teach and then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan a path through the tree of math skills to reach that skill.</li>
<li>View a report on how well your students can perform in each of the prerequisites.</li>
<li>Print worksheets for relevant skills, and assign those skills to the students' online assessment and review.</li>
<li>Monitor students' skill acquisition online.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kuskok organizes mixed review for your students based on each student's difficulty or ability on each problem type.

<p>Kuskok does not provide instruction; it aides any program of 
instruction used in your classroom. Kuskok monitors and reports on skill
 acquisition, advises the teacher on pre-requisite skills and their 
students' abilities, provides online skill practice, and organizes 
optimally-timed mixed-review.

<i class="fa fa-cubes"></i>
<h3>Mnego</h3>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:center">Your students are forgetting the facts.</p>
<p>Mnego manages fact-retention and frees you to teach the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Mnego is an online-flashcard manager for schools and districts. 
Create cards based on your own unique course content, share with other 
teachers in your district, or use our built-in card sets. Mnego 
features: </p>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
<ul>
<li>Spaced Repetition
<p>New facts require more frequent review; more practiced cards can be 
reviewed less frequently. If you teach your students to identify the 
Mississippi River on a map on Monday, that fact might need to be 
reviewed the next day and again on Thursday. Subsequent reviews might 
occur on the following Monday, then on Friday, then a week later, then 
two weeks after that, then a month later, etc.</p>
<p>Mnego uses scientific models of learning and memory to find "just the
 right time" to present each card to each student. Your students won't 
be frustrated either by wasting time reviewing facts they know too well 
or by being asked to recall facts that they have long-since forgotten.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
<ul>
<li>Cards Follow Students Until Graduation
<p>You teach life-long learners. When you assign the <emph>Nations of the Middle East</emph>
 card set, those cards do not get removed from your students' decks when
 they move on to the next grade. Those cards will remain with your 
students for as long as they are in a school using Mnego.
</p>
<p>Using the principle of spaced repetition, cards assigned in 
elementary school may only need to be reviewed twice a year by the time 
that student reaches high school. This is how Mnego maintains an entire 
education's worth of facts using only a few minutes a day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br style="clear:both">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
<ul>
<li>Adaptive Intervals
<p>Different students have different abilities to remember different 
facts. Each time Mnego presents a card, it gets simple feedback from the
 student that helps it schedule the next repetition. A fact forgotten or
 only barely remembered is re-presented sooner than a fact easily 
remembered.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
<ul>
<li>Cultured Card Sets
<p>Sometimes facts change: the UK promotes a new Prime Minister or 
Canada splits one territory into two. Your students are not constrained 
to the facts of the world as they stood when they first learned them. 
When change happens, Mnego updates your students' cards.

<h1>About Us</h1>
<div class="smallsep">
</div>
<p style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.2s; animation-name: bounceIn;" class="lead wow bounceIn animated animated" data-wow-delay="0.2s">
We are former educators making beautiful, usable, artificially intelligent software tools
<br>
that integrate into teachers' and administrators' daily practice.
</p>
</div>
<h2>User-Oriented Design</h2>
<p style="visibility: visible;" class="max80 wow fadeIn sig-gaq animated" data-sig-gaq="about">As
 former teachers, we know that a tool which is anything less than a 
pleasure to use will go unused. All of our design includes extensive 
interviews and observation with teachers, administrators, and students 
to make sure that our products satisfy your needs in the most clear, 
straight-forward, and easy-to-use way possible.</p>
<p style="visibility: visible;" class="max80 wow fadeIn animated">We're not satisfied with designing software that <i>can</i> be used to help your students; we make software that <i>will</i> be used to help your students.
</p><h2>Theory</h2>
<p style="visibility: visible;" class="max80 wow fadeIn animated">The 
artificial intelligence embedded into several of our products is built 
on well-developed theories of inference and learning. Here are some 
examples:</p>
<h3 class="max80">Optimal Review</h3>
<p style="visibility: visible;" class="max80 wow fadeIn animated">Optimal
 review is the science of picking the best possible time to present a 
student with a review question. If we wait too long to present a review 
question, the student may have forgotten how to solve the problem. If we
 present a review question too early, we are taking up time which may be
 better spent reviewing a different skill.</p>
<p style="visibility: visible;" class="max80 wow fadeIn animated">Scientists
 have known for the last century that the likelihood of forgetting a 
piece of knowledge over time can be modeled by a simple exponential 
curve. New information has a very steep likelihood to be forgotten, 
while familiar facts have a much shallower forgetting curve.</p>
<p style="visibility: visible;" class="max80 wow fadeIn animated">Our 
computers pick the best time for a student to review a skill. As the 
student continues to demonstrate their ability to use the skill 
correctly, the program presents that skill less frequently, leaving time
 to review more recently acquired skills.</p>
<h3 class="max80">A Tree of Knowledge</h3>
<p style="visibility: visible;" class="max80 wow fadeIn animated">How 
are academic skills related? Some skills are prerequisites to other 
skills: a student can't add fractions with unlike denominators unless 
they're also able to identify common multiples, produce equivalent 
fractions, and add integer numerators. Other skills are agonists: 
sometimes students confuse the strategy for adding fractions with the 
strategy for multiplying fractions.</p>
<p style="visibility: visible;" class="max80 wow fadeIn animated">If 
your student knows how to add fractions with unlike denominators, we 
consider that evidence towards their ability to identify common 
multiples, etc. Graph Theory and other well-developed mathematical 
sciences help us use this inferential evidence to make the best use of 
time during assessments and probe the causes of failed responses.</p>
